# Microsoft.Xrm.DevOps.PowerShell
This module builds on Microsoft.Xrm.Data.PowerShell and Microsoft.CrmSdk.XrmTooling.PackageDeployment to provide common functions to support a CI/CD pipeline with automatic builds and releases.

# Microsoft.Xrm.DevOps.Data
This module is a replacement for the venerable Microsoft Configuration Data Migration Tool. It is maintained separately as it can be a drop-in for any C# project.
